          My hobby is reading interesting and knowlegable books in my free time. Whenever I come back home from my school , I like to read all my lessons taught in the classes and after doing homeworks. I'm now 11 years old and read in class 7th. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep everyone happy and busy. It's a good source of enjoyment , knowledge , inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined and loyal , punctual and most importantly a successful person in our life.
